You can use the money you earn to buy upgrades. You can upgrade your speed, the timer, your bullet damage (First upgrade unlocks shooting), the coin worth, shooting reload time, and the enemy worth. When you collect $500 in a single game, the boss will appear and you will have to defeat it.\n\nYou start off with a very low speed and a timer that is three seconds long. If the timer runs out then you will lose. The timer restarts every time you collect a coin. Enemies will start coming in from off-screen. As you collect the coin, the speed of the enemies will change. You can't shoot them yet because you have to unlock it by upgrading the bullet damage upgrade. So, you will have to try avoiding them until the first bullet damage upgrade is purchased. Each coin you collect will not only reset the timer, but it will also add more to your money which you can use to buy more upgrades.

In some modes holding or defending a flag is the primary goal, where in others it is simply to obtain the most frags. For all game modes, the basic objective is to kill enemy players. Before spawning, the player is presented with a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. A few grenades and a molotov cocktail are also supplied by default and more grenades can be picked up from the ground. Some servers enable secondary functions like knives, shields or nuclear kamikaze attacks. Upon death players leave behind a health pack for healing injury, the weapon and any equipped grenades for others to pick up. After waiting for a server-specified amount of time (usually less than five seconds), players respawn and may choose another weapon—this cycle repeats for the duration of the map.
